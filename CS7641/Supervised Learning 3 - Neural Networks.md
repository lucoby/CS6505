# Supervise Learning 3 - Neural Networks

## Introduction
We use neural networks... aka Brains!!!

### Biology

A neuron is comprised of a cell body, axon, and synapses. When the cell body decides to fire it sends a spike/electrical impulse along the axon that is transmitted to other neuron via the synapses.

### Artificial (Perceptrons)

A first approximation of a neuron can be relatively is used for neurons and networks of neurons to compute things. The neurons can be tuned and trained to fire under different conditions. The neuron theta takes  inputs (x_1, x_2, x_3, ...) and has weights (w_1, w_2, w_3, ...). The neuron boils down to sum_i (x_i * w_i)  if the sum >= theta or the threshold, the neuron fires (y = 1) otherwise the it doesn't (y = 0). This type of neuron is referred to as a **perceptron**

The perceptron (in a simple 2 input scenario) creates a half-plane as the 2 inputs describe a linear function between 2 variables.


## Booleans as perceptrons

Perceptron can be used to describe boolean functions. Let x_1 \in {0, 1} and x_2 \in {0, 1} then a perceptron with w_1 = 1/2, w_2 = 1/2, and theta = 3/4 describes an AND function (there are in fact infinite functions that can describe AND)

w_1 = 1, w_2 = 1, theta = 1 describes OR (again infinite combinations can produce an OR function)

One input perceptrons can also be used to describe NOT i.e. w_1 = -1, theta = 0.

XOR is possible but requires 2 perceptrons. On way is to use an "and" perceptron that feeds its output into a second perceptron with the x_1 weight of 1, AND weight of -2 and x_2 weight of 1 with a theta of (essentially an OR function with the AND scenario negating the OR.)

## Training perceptrons

The goal is to find weights that map inputs to outputs. Algorithms include:
* perception rule (threshold values)
* Gradient descent/ delta rule (unthresholded values)

### Perceptron Rule -> Single unit

data set of unit bias, x, and y \in {0,1}. In this arrangement - \theta is just another weight

```tex
\begin{align}
y &: \textup{target} \\
\hat{y} &: \textup{output} \\
\eta &: \textup{learning rate}\\
x &: \textup{input}
\end{align}

```

For x,y repeat updating the rules while there is still an error:

```tex
w_i = w_i + \Delta w_i \newline
\Delta w_i = \eta (y - \hat{y}) x_i \newline
\hat{y} = (\sum_i{w_ix_i} \geq 0 )
```
Since:

| y     | \hat{y}   | y - \hat{y}   |
| ----- | --------- | ------------- |
| 0     | 0         | 0             |
| 0     | 1         | -1            |
| 1     | 0         | 1             |
| 1     | 1         | 0             |


the weight gets adjusted by a small amount (the learning rate) only when the output of the weight and the actual output are different. And the difference pushes the output in the right direction.

If there is an actual line that separates the output, it is **linearly separable**. If the data set is linearly separable, the perceptron rule will find it after a finite iterations.

The problem is if the data is not linearly separable. It's generally not easy to tell if the data is linearly separable. In 2 dimensions it can be easy to see but in higher orders it's a lot more difficult. If the algorithm isn't done running we aren't sure if we just haven't run the algorithm long enough or it's not actually linearly solveable... hope someone solves the halting problem.

## Gradient Decent

Gradient Descent is an algorithm that can accommodate data that isn't linearly separable. In order to do this we imagine the output is not thresholded.

```tex
\begin{align}
a &= \sum_i{x_iw_i} \\
\hat{y} &= {a \geq 0} \\
E(w) &= \frac{1}{2} \sum_{x,y \in D} {(y-a)^2} \\
\frac{\delta E}{\delta w_i} &= \frac{\delta}{\delta w_i} \frac{1}{2} \sum_{x,y \in D} {(y-a)^2} \\
&= \sum_{x,y \in D} {(y-a)} \frac{\delta}{\delta w_i}-\sum_i {x_iw_i} \\
&= \sum_{x,y \in D} {(y-a)} (-x_i)
\end{align}
```

(4) follows due to chain rule and substituting da/dw_i with the \sum_i{x_iw_i}
(5) follows due to paratial derivative only impacting the x_i term corresponding to the w_i term

## Learning rules

This very much resembles the perceptron rule (1 perceptron: guaranteed! finite convergence if linear separable, 2 gradient decent: calculus! robust, converge to local optimum): 

```tex
\begin{align}
\Delta w_i &= \eta (y-\hat{y})x_i \\
\Delta w_i &= \eta (y-a)x_i
\end{align}
```

Gradient can't be done on \hat{y} due to it being non differentiable. It's a step function.


## Sigmoid

```tex
\begin{align}
\sigma(a) &= \frac{1}{1 + e^{-a}} \\
D\sigma(a) &= \sigma(a)(1 - \sigma(a))
\end{align}
```

The sigmoid function has the properties as a -> -inf, sigma(a) -> 0 and as a -> inf, sigma(a) = inf, and sigma(0) = 1/2 (S like function). The derivative is easy to work with although there can be many other functions that work well with activation functions.

## Neural "Networks"

Network that is separated into several layers. Input layers for x_1, ... x_n. Output layer of y. In between there can be several hidden layers that are are neurons. If all of the hidden layer neurons are sigmoid units then the whole thing is differentiable which allows you to determine how a small change in any weight in any sigmoid in the network can impact the mapping from inputs to outputs even with the many non linearities created by the network.

Furthermore, there is propagation which is a *conceptually beneficial organization of chain rule* that allows error information to be backpropagated to adjust the network to make it more resemble what we desire.

Note that sigmoid isn't exactly a perceptron. It's not really a hard threshold, it doesn't guarantee convergence. There are many local optima.

## Optimizing weights

Gradient descent that attempts to find the local minima. There are many advanced methods to find global minima:
- Momentum - an "extra" factor that can help "push" past a local minima
- Higher order derivatives
- Randomized optimization
- Penalty for "complexity" - Similar to regression overfitting or large decision trees overfitting

> Optimization == learning

A more complex network consists of more nodes and more layers. In addition, if networks and weights are larger (even with the same nodes and layers) it can create a more complex network.

## Restriction Bias

Restriction bias is the representational power and the set of hypotheses that are being considered.

Perceptron: half-spaces
Sigmoid: Much more complex, not many restrictions with a big enough network

- Boolean: network of threshold-like units
- Continuous: "connected" (no jumps) requires 1 hidden layer (may need many units)
- Arbitrary: 2 hidden layers and allow for discontinuities

Neural nets overall have very little restrictions, but an arbitrary network can have restrictions. As a result there is a danger of overfitting. This can be mitigated by cross validation.

With neural nets, with more iterations error in training data decreases with more iterations but at some point the cross validation is u-shaped.

## Preference Bias

Algorithm's selection of one representation over another.

What algorithm? Gradient descent has to have initial weights!

A typical method is to start with small random values. Random because you can repeat several times and avoid local minimas. Small because if the weights get really big it can overfit. Smaller values have low complexity

Prefer incorrect over correct and prefer simpler all other things being similar (if the algorithm is good!)

**Occam's Razor** Entities should not be multiplied unnecessarily. Don't make things more complex unless you're decreasing error.

## Summary
- Perceptrons - Threshold unit
- Networks can produce boolean functions
- Perceptron rule - finite time for linearly separable
- General differentiable rule - using gradient descent and back propagation
- Preference/Restriction bias of neural networks
