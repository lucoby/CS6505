## Algorithms



## Filtering and Wrapping

Filtering is faster but ignores bias.

Wrapping is slower but useful

## Relevance vs Useful



### Relevance

Strong relevance - feature is needed by an prefect predictor

Weak relevance - feature can be useful to an prefect learner if it only had a subset of features

### Useful

Usefulness depends on the predictor. 

Since we don't have a perfect predictor, often we're more concerned with usefulness. Many filtering algorithms only explore things in terms of relevance
